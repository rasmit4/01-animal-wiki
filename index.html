        <p id="p1">Sea turtles have bodies that are protected by a shell. Their shells are made up of smaller plates called scutes. Leatherback sea turtles are the only turtles without hard shells; instead they have leathery skin that covers bony plates on top of their bodies. Unlike other animals, female and male sea turtles are the same size. Sea turtles are unable to retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection, while most other turtles have that ability. They have streamlined bodies that help reduce friction as they move through the ocean. Most sea turtles are 2 to 4 feet long. However, leatherback sea turtles are the largest. They can be 6 to 9 feet long and can weigh up to 1500lbs.</p>

            <p id="p2">Sea turtles are part of the Testudines order, along with other turtles and tortoises. All species of sea turtles are in the Cheloniidae family, except leatherback sea turtles which are a part of the Dermochelyidae family.
            <br><br>
            They originated nearly 150 million years ago in the Late Jurassic with genera such as Plesiochelys, from Europe. In Africa, the first sea turtle is Angolachelys, from the Turonian of Angola. However, neither of these are related to extant sea turtles; the oldest representative of the lineage leading to these was Desmatochelys padillai , from the Early Cretaceous. 
            <br><br>
            Sea turtles’ limbs and brains have evolved to adapt to their diets. One of the main things sea turtles consume is jellyfish and the use of their limbs to hold, swipe, and forage their food has helped them eat more efficiently.

        <p id="p3">Sea turtles have lungs that allow them to breathe air. However, they spend most of their time under water. When foraging for food they can stay under water 5–40 minutes. When sleeping they can stay under water 4–7 hours. Their diving endurance is reduced when they are forcibly submerged.</p>
            <h4>Reproduction</h4>
            <p id="p4">It takes decades for sea turtles to reach sexual maturity. Mature sea turtles may migrate thousands of miles to reach breeding sites. After mating at sea, adult female sea turtles return to land to lay their eggs. Different species of sea turtles exhibit various levels of philopatry. In the extreme case, females return to the same beach where they hatched. This can take place every two to four years in maturity.</p>
            
            <p id="p5">Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination. This means that warmer temperatures produce females and cooler temperatures produce males.</p>

        <p id="p6">Sea turtles are generally found in the waters over continental shelves. During the first three to five years of life, sea turtles spend most of their time in the pelagic zone floating in seaweed mats. Green sea turtles in particular are often found in Sargassum mats, in which they find shelter and food. Once the sea turtle has reached adulthood it moves closer to the shore. Females will come ashore to lay their eggs on sandy beaches during the nesting season.</p>
            <h4>Habitat</h4>
            <p id="p7">Sea turtles are found in all oceans, except for polar regions. The flatback sea turtle is found only on the coast of Australia. The Kemp’s ridley sea turtle is found only in the Gulf of Mexico and on the East Coast of the US. Sea turtles can usually be found in water above continental shelves. </p>
            <h4>Distribution</h4>
            <p id="p8">Sea turtles migrate to reach their spawning beaches, which are limited in numbers. Living in the ocean therefore means they usually migrate over large distances. All sea turtles have large body sizes, which is helpful for moving large distances. Large body sizes also offer good protection against the large predators found in the ocean.</p>

        <p id="p9">The loggerhead, Kemp’s ridley, olive ridley, and hawksbill sea turtles are omnivorous their entire life. Omnivorous turtles may eat a wide variety of plant and animal life including decapods, seagrasses, seaweed, sponges, mollusks, cnidarians, echinoderms, worms and fish. However, some species specialize on certain prey.
            <br><br>
        The diet of green sea turtles changes with age. Juveniles are omnivorous, but as they mature they become exclusively herbivorous. This diet shift has an effect on the green sea turtle’s morphology. Green sea turtles have a serrated jaw that is used to eat sea grass and algae.
            <br><br>
        Leatherback sea turtles feed almost exclusively on jellyfish and help control jellyfish populations.
        Hawksbill sea turtles principally eat sponges, which constitute 70–95% of their diets in the Caribbean.</p>

        <p id="p10">Sea turtles are caught worldwide, although it is illegal to hunt most species in many countries. A great deal of intentional sea turtle harvests worldwide are for food. Many parts of the world have long considered sea turtles to be fine dining. Ancient Chinese texts dating to the 5th century B.C.E. describe sea turtles as exotic delicacies.
        
            <br>
        To a much lesser extent, specific species of sea turtles are targeted not for their flesh, but for their shells. Tortoiseshell, a traditional decorative ornamental material used in Japan and China, comes from the carapace scutes of the hawksbill sea turtle.</p>
            <h4>Threats from Humans</h4>
            <p id="p11">Human pollution enters oceans and threatens the habitats of sea turtles and the food they eat. Sea turtles are often caught in nets and other pollution. They also end up eating plastic bags thinking they are jelly fish.</p>
